# How to contribute
Third-party patches are essential and appriciated. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your environment or enhance our projects with your ideas. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.
Although we try to translate our projects in various languages please write all commit/issue/comments in english language.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are explaining what and why you are doing something

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the ElementSystems organization.
* The core team of ElementSystems will look at the pull requests on a regular basis but any review is appreciated
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
